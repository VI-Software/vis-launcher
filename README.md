### Why AGPL Instead of GPL?

The GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) was chosen over the standard GPL because VIS Launcher connects to online services. AGPL extends GPL's protections to network services.

### Commercial Use License

While VIS Launcher is primarily licensed under AGPL-3.0, VI Software offers a separate commercial license that can be purchased:

```text
VIS LAUNCHER COMMERCIAL LICENSE
=========================================================

Entities may purchase a commercial license from VI Software that grants 
permission to use VIS Launcher for commercial purposes without the requirement 
to distribute the source code. This license:

1. Is granted on a case-by-case basis through a formal agreement
2. May be revoked if license terms are violated
3. Must be renewed according to the terms specified in the license agreement
4. Allows for specified modifications without triggering AGPL requirements

To inquire about purchasing a commercial license, contact VI Software at:

Without a valid commercial license, all use of VIS Launcher is governed by
the terms of the AGPL-3.0 license in full.
