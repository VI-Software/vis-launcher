## Security Policy

### Reporting a Vulnerability

At VI Software, we take security concerns seriously. If you discover any security vulnerabilities within our launcher, please let us know immediately. We appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing these issues to us and will work to address them promptly.


To report a vulnerability, please email us at contact (at) visoftware (dot) tech with a detailed description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it.

### Scope

This security policy applies to the VI Software launcher hosted on GitHub. It covers vulnerabilities within the launcher software itself, including but not limited to:

-   Remote code execution
-   Denial of service attacks
-   Cross-site scripting (XSS)
-   SQL injection
-   Authentication bypass
-   Information disclosure

### Exclusions

Please note that this policy does not cover vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies or services used by the launcher, unless they pose a direct risk to our users. However, we still encourage you to report such vulnerabilities to the respective maintainers.


### Disclosure Policy

We believe in responsible disclosure and will coordinate the release of security advisories with you, the reporter, to ensure that users have sufficient time to update their software before any vulnerabilities are publicly disclosed. We appreciate your cooperation in maintaining the security of our users.

### Code of Conduct

We expect all parties involved in the security disclosure process to adhere to our Code of Conduct. Any violations of this code will not be tolerated and may result in the termination of collaboration.
