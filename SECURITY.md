## Reporting a Vulnerability

At VI Software, security is a fundamental priority. We are committed to maintaining a secure and reliable open-source launcher. We highly appreciate responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities and encourage researchers to report potential issues directly to us.

- A clear and precise description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Potential impact assessment.
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or proof-of-concept code.

We acknowledge and value contributions to our security, and we will work diligently to address reported vulnerabilities in a timely manner.
